# ðŸ’ª Powerful Type Support

Existing libraries that handled Hangul lacked type support, preventing you from fully enjoying the benefits of type safety. `es-hangul` is written in TypeScript, providing a powerful type system.<br />
This enhances code safety and maintainability while preventing errors that may occur during the development process. Additionally, using `es-hangul` clearly defines function input and output types, improving code readability and boosting development efficiency through IDE auto-completion features.<br />
Choose `es-hangul` for stable and efficient Hangul processing!
